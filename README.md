# FollowCard

I did this project following this tutorial: "Curso de React 2023: De cero hasta crear tus primeros componentes con estado" by midudev, a web developer who creates content for people who are learning. This is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iobxzd_2wY.

In the video, midudev replicates the FollowCard of Twitter (Now X).


## Tech Stack

This is a front-end project in which I used **React** on the client side.


## Installation

To create this project, I run the command "npm create vite@latest" in the terminal (using git bash). I selected React and JavaScript + SWC.

Then, in the directory folder (cd FollowCard), I ran "npm install" to install the dependencies I needed. 

Next, you have to run the command "npm run dev" to initialize the project in the browser. (You have to do ctrl+click on the port shown in the terminal to follow the link to run it locally).
